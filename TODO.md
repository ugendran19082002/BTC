## DO THIS FIRST

**1. Change your Delta API key.**
The key in `app/server/.env` is the same one from `app-ket.txt`. That file was
pasted into chat several times, so anyone who saw the chat has your key. It
works right now — the desk reads your balance with it. Go to Delta, delete that
key, make a new read-only one, paste the new one into `app/server/.env`, and
run `./deploy/deploy.sh`.

The setup around it is safe: the file is not in git, not in any Docker image,
and only loaded when the server starts. Only the key itself is the problem.

**2. Decide who can open the site.**
Right now anyone who types the address can see it, including your position
sizing. Two ways to close it:
- Put a password on it — uncomment two lines in `deploy/nginx.conf`, then run
  `sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd-delta yourname`.
- Or make it private — this machine already runs Tailscale, so change the web
  port in `deploy/docker-compose.yml` to your Tailscale address.

**3. Get the 29-Mar-2025 trade log from AlgoTest.**
Only you can log in and download it. AlgoTest says that day made money, my
version says it lost money, and until we know why, every number in this project
is a *guess* about your real results, not a measurement of them.

## WHAT THE DESK DOES NOW

You open it, and it tells you one of three things: **Enter**, **Not yet**, or
**Stand aside** — with the reasons.

When it says Enter, it gives you the exact orders: which strike, which side,
how many lots, at what price.

### The rules it follows

Three rules. Each one was tested on 733 days and had to work in 2024, 2025
*and* 2026 separately before it was allowed in.

**Rule 1 — pick the strike.**
Take the furthest strike that still pays your minimum premium. Rank them by how
often strikes like that actually expired worthless, using 27,371 real
settlements — not by what the maths model claims.

**Rule 2 — split the lots.**
Normally half calls, half puts. But if BTC moved more than 2% in 24 hours *and*
the daily trend agrees, put 70% on the side that keeps paying if the move
carries on.
Result: profit factor 1.93 → 2.38. Worst day −$8.97 → −$7.08.

**Rule 3 — skip bad days.**
If daily RSI is above 70 or below 30, don't trade.
Result: profit factor 1.93 → 2.59. Costs about one day in nine.

**All three together:** ₹7,319 → ₹8,250, and it trades 80 *fewer* days.
Profit factor 1.93 → 3.08. Biggest drawdown $12.22 → $8.24.

### Three different "chance of going to zero"

These are three different questions and the desk keeps them apart:

| Shown as | Means |
|---|---|
| **→ 0** (big number) | the maths, corrected by what really happened to 27,371 strikes like it |
| **ends out of the money** | the raw maths answer, N(d2), before that correction |
| **ever touches your strike** | might cross it at some point, even if it comes back the right side |
| **premium drops to near zero first** | the option price collapses before expiry — simulated, 2,000 paths |

Two things that are **not** part of this:

- **Delta is not a probability.** The desk used to treat it as one. Fixed.
- **Open interest and volume are not part of it either.** They tell you whether
  you can get filled and get out. They do not change the odds of the strike
  expiring worthless — only distance, volatility and time do that.

### Why every strike now shows a different number

The history is grouped into 5-point buckets, so reading a bucket rate straight
off gave every strike in the bucket the same percentage. A call and a put with
completely different open interest showed an identical number, which looked
broken — and it hid the difference between a strike at the edge of a bucket and
one in the middle.

The bucket now supplies a *correction* instead: how far reality sat from the
maths for strikes like this, blended between neighbouring buckets and added to
this strike's own number. So 78,000 reads 2.41% and 78,200 reads 4.16%, where
both used to read 13.56%.

## WHAT WAS TESTED AND THROWN OUT

Do not put these back without new evidence. Each looked promising and failed.

| Idea | What happened |
|---|---|
| Stop loss | Cut profit by more than half at every level. ₹14,638 → ₹4,201. It cuts winners. |
| Skip low-volume days | ₹7,319 → ₹3,836 |
| OI acceleration | Great on its own, useless combined. 2026 fell from 6.53 to 2.49 |
| Lean toward the "safer" side | 2.10, worse than the momentum rule |
| Lean toward the riskier side | 1.80, worse than doing nothing |
| MACD alone | 1.96 against a 1.93 baseline. Noise. |
| Skip when the market underprices risk | Looked brilliant in 2026, collapsed to 1.06 in 2024. Classic overfit. |
| ATR filters | Less profit, no less risk |

### Other things that are worked out, not typed in

- **The at-the-money strike** is calculated from live spot every refresh.
- **Strike spacing** is now read from the strikes Delta is actually listing,
  not assumed to be $200. Delta uses $200 near the money and $400 further out,
  and that is an observation about today, not a promise.
- **Lots per side** are worked out each refresh from the 24-hour move and the
  daily trend. The 70/30 figure is fixed — a version that scaled smoothly with
  signal strength was tested and was worse in 2024 and 2026.
- **The two sides always add up to your total.** They used to be able to sum to
  eight lots for a seven-lot decision.

## THINGS WORTH DOING NEXT

- **Exit rule.** Closing when the option has lost 95% of its value beat holding
  to expiry — ₹15,225 vs ₹14,638 — and the target was hit on 97.5% of days,
  usually about 8 hours in. The desk only handles entries so far.
- **Weekend.** Monday to Friday lost on 3 days out of 461, worst −$0.95.
  Saturday and Sunday lost on 7 out of 209, worst −$8.48, and hold all six of
  the biggest losses in two years. The desk warns you; it does not stop you.
- **Hedging is mostly not available.** At the distance this strategy sells,
  Delta lists nothing further out to buy on about 3 days in 4. Where it does,
  the hedge often costs almost as much as the premium. That is why the tested
  version is naked and controls risk with position size instead.
- **12-hour direction forecast.** Still just a written plan in
  `PREDICTION-ENGINE-SPEC.md`. What exists today is a market read, clearly
  labelled as background information, not a signal.

## HOW THE CODE IS KEPT HONEST

- **39 tests**, run automatically before every deploy. `npm test` in
  `app/server`. They cover the probability maths, the pricer, the split rule,
  lot allocation, strike-step detection and the summary statistics.
- They have already caught three real bugs: lots summing above the total, a
  negative zero in the statistics, and every strike in a bucket reading the same.
- Nothing goes into the recommendation unless it worked in 2024, 2025 **and**
  2026 separately. Everything else is shown as background and labelled as such.

## RULES I WORK BY

- AlgoTest is the truth. This project is a hypothesis until they agree.
- India only. All times IST. $1 = ₹85.
- I never log into your AlgoTest account.
- Nothing in this code can place an order. There is no code path for it.
- Nothing goes into the recommendation unless it worked in all three years.
